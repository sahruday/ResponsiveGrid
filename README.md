The responsive layout grid is made up of three elements: columns, gutters, and margins.
* Columns - Content is placed in the areas of the screen that contain columns.
* Gutters - A gutter is the space between columns that helps separate content.
* Margins - Margins are the space between content and the left and right edges of the screen.

Based on the Device Sizes these values vary to adapte the situation.
